## Course information

Studying discrete structures has been a transformative experience, connecting abstract mathematical concepts to practical applications in computer science. Analyse set theory, proof
techniques, relations, functions and recurrence relation to solve computer science problems.We can learn how to explain and solve the problem of counting using counting methods.Moreover, I also learn how to apply the graph theory and trees in real world problems.Student can identify deterministic finite automata and finite state machines to model certain electronic devices.Topics like set theory, logic, graph theory, combinatorics, and relations have enhanced my problem-solving and analytical thinking.
